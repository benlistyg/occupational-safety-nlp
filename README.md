# Occupational Incident NLP Analysis

# Background

* I wanted to implement a structural topic model, a type of topic modelling approach that allows for the analyst to include covariates and meta-data when estimating latent themes or topics in a corpus of text data
* The code in this repo estimates a 3 to 6 solution topic model on occupational incident reports from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) covering a time period from `2015-01-01` to `2022-09-02`
* These results are presented in a dashboard for a data consumer to peruse the findings via the `{stminsights}` package

# Results

* While these results are very preliminary, I find a four topic solution appears to fit reasonably well using both empirical (e.g. model fit statistics like semantic coherence and exclusivity) and rational methods (reading the representative documents) to evalute the results
